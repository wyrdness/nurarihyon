      "summary": "Mysterious Japanese yokai depicted as an old man with an elongated bald head who slips into homes uninvited and acts as if he owns the place. Modern interpretations portray him as the supreme commander of all yokai.",
      "full": "Nurarihyon is one of Japan's most enigmatic yokai, whose legend has evolved significantly over time. Originally described as a vague sea creature in early folklore, Nurarihyon transformed into a mysterious home invader—an impeccably dressed old man with a distinctive elongated bald head who enters homes without permission, drinks tea, and behaves as though he owns the place. Homeowners find themselves unable to question his presence due to his supernatural charm and commanding authority. In modern popular culture, particularly through GeGeGe no Kitaro and other manga/anime, Nurarihyon has been elevated to the status of supreme commander of all yokai, a powerful leader who commands respect and obedience from other supernatural beings. This evolution from obscure folklore figure to iconic yokai leader demonstrates the dynamic nature of Japanese supernatural traditions."
